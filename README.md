Chip 8/SChip/XO-Chip Interpreter

Mostly written to test my display framework - should scale smoothly and maintain aspect.
Current adheres to the spec for the original Cosmac-VIP Chip-8 interpreter, with cycle accuracy. 
Super-Chip (Legacy 1.0/1.1 and Modern) are fixed ipf.
xo-chip lacks sound but passes all tests.

Uses 1234 to ZXCV keys on left side of UK/US keyboard.
